    "# Assignment 2: Transformer Architecture Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a reference implementation for **Assignment 2** of the generative AI course.  The goal is to compare three prominent transformer architectures—**decoder‑only**, **encoder‑only**, and **encoder‑decoder**—on a common generative task.  The assignment requires training each architecture on the same dataset, evaluating their performance with common metrics, and analysing the implications of architectural differences on generative tasks and chain‑of‑thought reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we use the **CNN/DailyMail** summarisation dataset (version `3.0.0`) from Hugging Face’s `datasets` library.  The dataset comprises news articles paired with human‑written summaries; each article–summary pair provides a natural input/output example for a generative model.  Because the data are already split into training/validation/test splits and are widely used for abstractive summarisation research, this dataset is appropriate for comparing generative architectures.  Although `WikiText` could be used for language modelling tasks, summarisation requires models to generate structured output given an input, which better illustrates differences between decoder‑only, encoder‑only, and encoder‑decoder designs.  For compute efficiency in this notebook we subsample the dataset (e.g. a few hundred training examples) rather than using the full corpus.\n"

    "## Overview of transformer architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "We train three different transformer models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoder‑only (GPT‑style):** These models consist of stacked self‑attention blocks in which each token can attend only to previous tokens (causal masking).  We use `GPT‑2` as the base model and fine‑tune it to generate a summary from an article.  Because GPT‑2 is a pure language model, we construct input prompts of the form `\"summarize: <article>\"` and train the model to predict the target summary.  During training we mask out the prompt part of the input so that the loss is computed only on the summary tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder‑only (BERT‑style):** Encoder‑only models such as `BERT` learn bi‑directional contextual representations using masked language modelling (MLM).  They are not inherently generative; they excel at understanding tasks (e.g. classification, token classification).  For a fair comparison on generative tasks we fine‑tune BERT on the same corpus using MLM, combining article and summary text into a single sequence.  At evaluation time we assess perplexity and use the `fill‑mask` capability to approximate generation.  This highlights BERT’s limitations on tasks requiring free‑form generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder‑decoder (T5‑style):** Models like `T5` encode the input sequence with an encoder and decode the output sequence with a separate decoder.  They can perform a wide range of text‑to‑text tasks, including summarisation and question answering.  We fine‑tune `T5‑small` on the CNN/DailyMail dataset using the standard prefix `\"summarize: \"` in the input to indicate the task.  During evaluation we compute ROUGE metrics on generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections implement data loading, preprocessing, model fine‑tuning, and evaluation for each architecture.\n"

Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'\", 'highlights': 'John and .\\nAudrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen .\\nThey were found at Tremarle Home Park in Cornwall .\\nInvestigators say the three died of carbon monoxide .\\npoisoning .', 'id': '08cf276c9eadb638e0c7fdc83ce0229c8af5d09b'}\n"

We concatenate the article and its summary into a single sequence and randomly mask tokens using `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`.  While BERT cannot directly generate summaries, we compute perplexity to gauge how well it models the joint distribution of article and summary tokens.  At evaluation we also demonstrate how to use the `fill-mask` pipeline to generate single masked words as an illustration of BERT’s generative limitations.\n"

    "\n",
    "T5 is a text‑to‑text model that uses a separate encoder and decoder.  It naturally handles generative tasks such as summarisation.  We prepend the prefix `\"summarize: \"` to each article, then tokenize the input and the summary separately.  A `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` takes care of padding the inputs and shifting the decoder labels.  During evaluation we use greedy decoding to produce summaries and compute ROUGE scores against the reference summaries.\n"

Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'\", 'highlights': 'John and .\\nAudrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen .\\nThey were found at Tremarle Home Park in Cornwall .\\nInvestigators say the three died of carbon monoxide .\\npoisoning .', 'id': '08cf276c9eadb638e0c7fdc83ce0229c8af5d09b'}\n"

    "## Analysis and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After fine‑tuning the models and running the evaluation routines, you should fill in a comparison of the results.  Typical observations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoder‑only (GPT‑2):** GPT‑2 fine‑tuned on a summarization corpus learns to generate coherent summaries.  Its perplexity should decrease significantly compared with the pre‑trained model, and ROUGE scores should improve.  Because GPT‑2 has no separate encoder, it must memorize how to map the input prompt to the desired output, which can make training less sample‑efficient for conditional tasks.  However, at inference time GPT‑2 generates outputs quickly via a single decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder‑only (BERT):** BERT excels at understanding tasks but struggles with generative tasks.  MLM fine‑tuning improves its perplexity on the article‑summary text, but it cannot generate full summaries.  The `fill‑mask` pipeline can fill individual tokens, but the lack of an auto‑regressive decoder makes long‑form generation impractical.  This illustrates why encoder‑only architectures are not suited for free‑form text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder‑decoder (T5):** T5 is designed for text‑to‑text tasks and typically achieves the best summarization scores among the three models when fine‑tuned properly.  Its separate encoder compresses the input, and the decoder generates output conditioned on the encoded context.  T5 often yields higher ROUGE scores and lower perplexity than GPT‑2 on summarization because the architecture explicitly models conditional generation.  The trade‑off is increased computational cost due to the encoder and decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain‑of‑thought (CoT) reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain‑of‑thought reasoning refers to models generating intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer.  Decoder‑only models (like GPT‑2 and GPT‑3) naturally support CoT prompting because they generate text token by token.  Encoder‑decoder models like T5 can also perform CoT when prompted appropriately (e.g. instructing the model to \"think step by step\").  Encoder‑only models lack a decoding mechanism and therefore are not directly applicable to CoT generation.  In practice, CoT reasoning quality improves with larger models and more sophisticated training (e.g. instruction‑tuning or reinforcement learning with human feedback), which are beyond the scope of this introductory exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we implemented and compared three transformer architectures on a common summarization task using the CNN/DailyMail dataset.  We demonstrated how to fine‑tune a decoder‑only model (GPT‑2), an encoder‑only model (BERT), and an encoder‑decoder model (T5).  The code illustrated data preprocessing, training setups, and evaluation routines using ROUGE and perplexity metrics.  While only small subsets of the dataset were used for demonstration purposes, you should expand the training data and adjust hyperparameters for a thorough experiment.  The analysis underscores the strengths and limitations of each architecture and highlights why encoder‑decoder models are generally preferred for conditional text generation tasks like summarization.\n"

    "# Assignment 2: Transformer Architecture Exercise\n",
    "Use this notebook as a starting point and expand on your understanding of transformer models by completing the following structured tasks. You are encouraged to experiment, analyze, and critically reflect on your findings in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Model Training & Implementation\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Preparation\n",
    "- Choose one standard text dataset suitable for generative tasks. Options include:\n",
    "  - CNN/DailyMail → summarization\n",
    "  - WikiText-2 → language modeling (text generation)\n",
    "  - SQuAD v1.1 → question answering\n",
    "- Briefly describe why you selected this dataset and what task you’ll evaluate (summarization, QA, or text generation).\n",
    "- Show how you preprocessed the data (tokenization, train/val split, max length, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement and train the following:\n",
    "- Decoder-only model (GPT-style): e.g., GPT-2 small from Hugging Face.\n",
    "- Encoder-only model (BERT-style): e.g., BERT-base, used for masked-language-modeling or extractive QA/summarization.\n",
    "- Encoder-decoder model (T5-style): e.g., T5-small, trained for the same dataset/task as the other two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Training Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document your training setup (batch size, learning rate, optimizer, epochs, hardware).\n",
    "- Save a few training/validation loss curves or logs to show how training progressed.\n",
    "- Mention any difficulties you faced and how you addressed them (e.g., memory limits, convergence).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Evaluation & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate all three models on the same task.\n",
    "- Report results using at least two metrics:\n",
    "  - Text generation/summarization: BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity\n",
    "  - Question answering: F1, Exact Match (EM), BLEU\n",
    "- Include 1–2 sample outputs per model to illustrate qualitative differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Comparative Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture on your chosen task.\n",
    "- Suggested angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Decoder-only: fluent text generation, but weaker at bidirectional context.\n",
    "  - Encoder-only: strong understanding of context, but not designed for open generation.\n",
    "  - Encoder-decoder: flexible, strong on conditional generation tasks (summarization, QA).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which model seemed easiest to fine-tune?\n",
    "- Which produced the best outputs on your dataset?\n",
    "- Which was the most efficient (speed, memory)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Reflections on Applicability\n",
    "\n",
    "- In what real-world scenarios would you prefer each architecture?\n",
    "- Briefly note whether you think CoT reasoning would have helped these models if you had added it (conceptual discussion only—no experiments required)."
